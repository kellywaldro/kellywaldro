### Hi, I'm Kelly!

I'm a geographer turned data journalist. I like maps, scraping, and cleaning messy datasets. 

I'm currently in the Data Journalism program at Columbia. Before that, I used to work for a remote sensing company analysing methane emissions using satellite imagery ðŸ›°.  

Check out my analysis / viz / troubleshooting here.
