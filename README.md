### Hi, I'm Kelly!

I'm a geographer turned data journalist. I like maps, scraping, and cleaning messy datasets. 

I'm a data journalist at Mission Local, and recent graduate of the the Data Journalism program at Columbia Journalism School. Before that, I used to work for a remote sensing company analyzing methane emissions using satellite imagery ðŸ›°.
